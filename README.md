#*Dotfiles*

These are the dotfiles for my configurations, these may or may not apply to you
depending upon various factors, I suggest you not to completely copy it and do it
yourself as there is a high risk of mis-configuration as we may not have the same
systems and hardware and so on.

I plan to make an installation script later.
